title: "About Me"
description: "I am a lover of the outdoors. You can find me hiking, biking, river rafting or just walking around the neighborhood. I first moved to Heber City in the early nineties, spent my teenage years here and moved back 3 years ago.  I always enjoy a good book especially a good biography. I am excited for this chance to run for city council to work with you to make our home better."
