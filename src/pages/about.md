title: "About Me"
description: "I first moved to Heber in the early nineties and just moved back 3 years ago to be closer to my parents. I am a lover of the outdoors and Heber does a great job of providing access to that. You can find me hiking, biking, river rafting or just walking around the neighborhood. I always enjoy a good book especially a good biography. I am excited for this chance to run for city council to work with you to make our home better."

#### Principles

1. Love, kindness and curiosity should guide each interaction with others.
1. Make decisions with the long view of multiple generations in mind.

#### Qualifications

My career has been in software engineering with experience working across teams, building scalable solutions used by millions of people every day.  My work across teams and organizations has helped me develop the skills necessary to clearly communicate, ask questions, learn from others and deliver products with features customers need to run their business.

I am a member of the Heber City Park, Open Space, Trails and Trees Advisory Comittee. While there I have gained experience seeing how the city works and been grateful for all the work that goes into making our city better.

I am a paying member of the Wasatch Trails Foundation and when I can will be out on the Dig Days (trail maintenance) on the second saturday of each month. I hope you join us!

I bring energy, excitment and a strong work ethic to get things done.
